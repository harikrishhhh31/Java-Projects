# Java Backend Journey

This repository marks the start of my backend learning journey.

I began by building a basic HTTP server in Java (no frameworks) to understand how ports, HTTP requests, responses, and handlers actually work.

I’ll be updating this repository consistently as I learn and improve step by step.

Focus: fundamentals first, frameworks later.
